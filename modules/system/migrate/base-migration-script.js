/**
 * This is the base class for migration scripts. All migrations should extend this class and
 * implement the methods needed, which depends on what changed in the data model (actors, items, etc).
 *
 * To Use:
 *   1. Create a migration script file in the `/src/modules/system/migrate/scripts` directory
 *      following naming conventions.
 *   2. Extend this class. Copy/paste a previous migration script to see how it's done.
 *   3. Override the `version`, `name` and `documentFilters` static properties.
 *      See below for details, and other migration scripts for examples.
 *   4. Write your script by overriding the following methods: `updateItem`, `updateActor` or both.
 *      Again, see below for details.
 *   5. Add an export statement pointing to your script in `./index.js`.
 *   6. Finally, increment the `#LATEST_VERSION` static property in `../migration.js`.
 *   7. Test to make sure your migrations work.
